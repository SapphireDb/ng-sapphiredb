<h1>Connection types</h1>

<div class="remark success">
  Realtime database supports different types of connection. This makes client implementations very easy.<br>
  Realtime database can also support older browsers with the connections.
</div>

<h2>Available connection types</h2>

<h3>Websocket</h3>

<div class="remark info">
  Websocket is a modern technology for bi-directional data transfer. The server and client can push data through the connection.
</div>

<h3>Server sent events (SSE)</h3>

<div class="remark info">
  Server sent events use an open connection that can be used by the server to push data to the client. The client can send
  data using normal http requests.
</div>

<h3>Polling</h3>

<div class="remark info">
  If the client does not support any of the other methods you can also switch to polling. The data will be requested
  in a defined interval. Data will be transferred through normal http requests.<br>
  You can define the <code>pollingTime</code> in a seperate field of the options.
</div>

<h2>Demo</h2>

<div class="remark warning">
  This small demo changes the connection type of the whole application. You can test every section with the different connection types.
</div>

<button class="mr-5" m4-button (click)="setConnectionType('websocket')">Use Websocket</button>
<button class="mr-5" m4-button (click)="setConnectionType('sse')">Use SSE</button>
<button m4-button (click)="setConnectionType('poll')">Use Polling</button>

<h2>Set connection type</h2>

<div class="remark success">
  ng-realtime-database automatically switches the connection type to one the client supports. You can also define it manually.
