<h1>Offline support</h1>

<p>
  SapphireDb support offline usage and can store and load data from a local storage.<br>
  Changes made offline and online will be synced and automatically merged.
</p>

<h2>Basic setup</h2>

<div class="remark success">
  To enable offline support just activate the option <code>offlineSupport</code> in your client application.
</div>

<app-doc [showContent]="false">
  <div lang>
    <![CDATA[
    \f:(typescript:JS)
    var sapphiredb = require('sapphiredb');\n\n

    var db = new sapphiredb.SapphireDb({\n
      \tofflineSupport: true\n
    });
    ]]>
  </div>
</app-doc>

<h3>Setup storage</h3>

<div class="remark info">
  To store data locally and benefit from offline support you have to provide a storage. For normal browsers you can use
  <code>SapphireLocalStorage</code>. For other environments you should implement a custom storage provider.
</div>

<app-doc [showContent]="false">
  <div lang>
    <![CDATA[
    \f:(typescript:JS)
    var sapphiredb = require('sapphiredb');\n\n

    var db = new sapphiredb.SapphireDb({\n
      \tofflineSupport: true,\n
    }, new sapphiredb.SapphireLocalStorage());
    ]]>
  </div>
</app-doc>

<div class="remark info">
  In angular you can provide the custom storage as <code>SapphireStorage</code> in providers of your module
</div>

<h2>Prepare models</h2>

<div class="remark info">
  Without configuring anything SapphireDb can already store collection state and local operations. But it will not be possible to create
  new values in a collection and update them without going online again. <br>
  To use that you have to generate some sort of id on client side when creating new values. (UUIDs/GUIDs are ideal for that)
</div>

<div class="remark success">
  Use the class <code>SapphireOfflineEntity</code> in every model that should work offline. It has an auto generated
  id property and a timestamp for concurrency conflict detection.
</div>

<app-doc [showContent]="false">
  <div lang>
    <![CDATA[
    \f:(csharp:Entry.cs)
    // Server side usage\n
    public class DemoEntry : SapphireOfflineEntity\n
    {\n
      \tpublic string Content { get; set; }\n
    }

    \f:(typescript:entry.ts)
    // Client side usage\n
    class Entry extends SapphireOfflineEntity {\n\n

    }

<h2>Conflict handling</h2>

<div class="remark success">
  SapphireDb can handle a lot of conflicts automatically. Check out <a routerLink="../conflict-handling">Conflict handling</a> to learn more.
</div>

<h2>Note</h2>

<div class="remark info">
  <ul>
    <li>
      Server side model validation will only get executed on server side. It is possible to insert invalid values on client side that are rejected later.<br>
      Add additional client side validation to avoid that
    </li>
    <li>
      Some prefilters like First, Count etc. will online work limited offline. The state before going offline will
      get stored but operations on the collection will first take effect when going online again.
    </li>
    <li>
      The prefilters Skip and Take will have no effect when offline. If you add new values they are always displayed by the prefilter.
    </li>
    <li>
      Every collection value with different prefilters is stored in a different storage. That can result in sometimes
      different values when using different prefilters. To avoid that only use one combination of prefilters in one
      scope of the application.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
